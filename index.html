Hi, my name is Jangwon Lee.

I'm a Fullstack Developer who specializes on the backend. I am also the founder of Vancouver Softworks.

I create and maintain custom web applications for my clients. This includes specing out requirements, creating the database, developing the backend, mapping out the frontend, and hosting the website.

Currently, I'm working for SOCi and doing maintainance for my former clients.
